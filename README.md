# Me & a typewriter

A microblog based on markdownfiles.
I really love to use markdown for my private notes, recipes, articles etc.
So I decided to script a simple microblogging system in php which is based on markdown.

## Libraries & sources
* [parsedown]:(https://github.com/erusev/parsedown) for parsing.
* Stylesheets from [markdowncss]:(https://markdowncss.github.io/).
