# me & a typewriter

Edition Ni


ChatGPT

A very simple blog system that displays Markdown files as articles in a responsive web view.

I really love Markdown and have used it for my private notes, recipes, articles, and the novel, which will be released as soon as I retire. üòÑ

I prefer Typora for editing my Markdown files (https://typora.io/), but you are free to use any editor‚Äîeven "echo >" will do the job.

## Markdown?

Markdown is a easy-to-learn markup language to style text without a big fat editor.

Eg. '# Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet' eq. '<h1>' or '** lorem **' for emphasis.

## Libraries

__parsedown__ for parsing the Markdown files (https://github.com/erusev/parsedown)

## Simple
__me & a typewriter__ don't need a database. Just create your content and upload (via ftp or scp) the md-file into /md/.

 * create or edit a privacy.md, about.md, impress.md for further legal informations and a notes about your blog.

 * add a div with the class "tags" to your markdown-file, eg.

   ```<div class="tags">Test, News, Code</div>```
